# Module 04 — ETL Projects

The ETL Projects module combines the Extract, Transform, and Load components to build complete pipelines. It includes guided and unguided implementations that simulate real ETL workflows.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- pandas for data handling throughout the pipeline  
- requests for API-based extraction  
- os for directory and path operations  
- datetime for timestamp management in final outputs  

## Purpose
This module integrates individual ETL stages into cohesive, end-to-end workflows. It represents practical pipeline assembly using the foundational components defined in earlier modules.

## Concepts Addressed
- Multi-source ETL integration  
- Pipeline orchestration  
- Data validation steps  
- Modular ETL architecture  

## Files Included
- guided_etl_notebook.py  
- mini_project_1.py  
- mini_project_2.py  
- final_project.py  

## Module Summary
The ETL Projects module showcases complete ETL implementations. It demonstrates the interaction between modules and provides structured examples aligned with realistic engineering patterns.
